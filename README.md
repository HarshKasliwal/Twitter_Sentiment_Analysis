 ## Dataset Extraction

- Install Kaggle Python Package: Install the Kaggle Python package using your preferred method (e.g., pip install kaggle). This package allows you to interact with the Kaggle platform programmatically from your Python environment.

- Set Up Kaggle API Credentials: Create a directory named .kaggle in your home directory. Copy your Kaggle API credentials file (kaggle.json) into this directory. Ensure that only you have read and write permissions for this file (chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json). This step ensures that the Kaggle API can authenticate your requests securely.

- Download Dataset from Kaggle: Use the Kaggle API to download a dataset from Kaggle. Specify the dataset ID or name when downloading the dataset. You can use the kaggle datasets download command followed by the dataset ID or name.

- Extract Dataset: After downloading the dataset, extract its contents from the downloaded ZIP file. You can use any suitable method to extract the files, such as using Python's ZipFile module or any file extraction tool.

By following these instructions, we successfully download and extract a dataset from Kaggle using its API.
